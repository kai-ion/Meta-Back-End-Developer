1.  Which of the following syntax is valid when using the path () function? Select all that apply.
    - path(views.login, 'login/')
    - path('login/', name='login')
    - path('login/', views.login, name='login')
    - path('login/', views.login)

    ```
        Answer: path('login/', views.login, name='login')
                path('login/', views.login)
        Explanation: The path() function may have an optional argument for the URL name. The first two arguments to this function are the URL pattern string and the path to the view function. You can pass name as a third optional argument for the URL name.
                     The urlpatterns contain a list of path objects. The path() function’s two mandatory arguments are the URL pattern string and the view function.

2.  True or False. The view function calls the render () function to load a template and returns its response to the client. 
    - True
    - False

    ```
        Answer: True
        Explanation: The render() function loads the template, populates the context data, and sends the function’s return value as a response.
    ```

3. True or False. The correct syntax to import the path () function in the urls.py file is from django.urls import path. 
    - True
    - False


    ```
        Answer: True
        Explanation: The path() function should be imported from the django.urls module.
    ```

4. Yes or No. Is it mandatory to define views in the views.py file?
    - Yes
    - No

    ```
        Answer: No
        Explanation: It is not necessary to define views in a file named views.py to store view functions, although it is a common practice. You can use any file name, but ensure that it is imported into the urls.py file when updating the urlpattern list.
    ```

5. Which of the following statements about the include () function is true. Select all that apply.
    - The include() function includes, in the URL patterns, the URL mapping to a view function.
    - The include() function is used to include the URL pattern definitions of an app in the project.
    - The include() function is defined in the django.urls module.
    - You should pass a string representing the path of the app's urls module to the include() function.


    ```
        Answer: The include() function is used to include the URL pattern definitions of an app in the project.
                The include() function is defined in the django.urls module.                
                You should pass a string representing the path of the app's urls module to the include() function.
        Explanation: It updates the project’s URL pattern list by including the pattern list of an app.
                     The include() function is defined in the django.urls module.

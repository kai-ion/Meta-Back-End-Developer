1. Consider the following code for the urls.py  file at both the project level and the app level.
    App-level urls.py:
    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('home/', views.home, name="home"),
    ]
    ```

    Project-level urls.py
    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('little/', include('myapp.urls')),
    ]
    ```

    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/little/home 
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/little
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/little

    ```
        Answer: http://127.0.0.1:8000/little/home 
        Explanation: The URL paths are mapped from project to app level, so the project level path will prefix the app level path.
    ```

2. In the lab you just completed, you worked in the urls.py file of an app called myapp. You needed to import the view module using the import statement. 

    Which of the following code snippets could you have used. Select all that apply.
    - from myapp import views  
    - from myproject import views   
    - from . import views  
    - from * import views

    ```
        Answer: from myapp import views     
                The code from myapp import views implies importing the contents of the views.py file into the current urls.py file.      
        Explanation: The code from myapp import views implies importing the contents of the views.py file into the current urls.py file.      
                     The dot (.) implies the current working directory and will successfully import the file views.py as it is in the same directory.     
    ```

3.  In the lab you just completed, you used the include() function in the project-level urls.py file. Which package is the include function imported from?     
    - You import the include() function from the django.urls package.    
    - You import the include() function from the django.contrib package.      
    - The include() function is present by default in the project level urls.py file and does not need to be imported.

    ```
        Answer: You import the include() function from the django.urls package.    
        Explanation: The include() function along with the path() function are imported from the django.urls package. 
    ```

    ```
        Answer: A Django template represents the presentation layer of the web application.
                A Django template can have blocks of template language syntax in between the HTML script.
                A Django template is an HTML document.
        Explanation: The variable context data is filled inside the web page to render a good-looking response on the client browser. 
                     The variable content in the HTML script is marked by blocks of Django Template Language statements.
                     A template is an HTML script and is saved with the .html extension.

2. Does a template in Django correspond to the view layer in MVC architecture? 
    - Yes
    - No

    ```
        Answer: Yes
        Explanation: Django follows MVT architecture in which the template is a view layer corresponding to the view layer in MVC.
    ```

3. Which of the following statements about the view () function is correct. Select all that apply.
    - The View function populates the template with context data.
    - The View function is invoked by the URL dispatcher.
    - The View function returns a HTTP response to the client.
    - The View function interacts with the model.

    ```
        Answer: The View function populates the template with context data.
                The View function is invoked by the URL dispatcher.
                The View function returns a HTTP response to the client.
                The View function interacts with the model.
        Explanation: It uses the request parameters and/or the data fetched from the model to be inserted in the template.
                     Django uses the URLConf to identify the view that matches with the pattern of the client URL.
                     It reads the template and returns it to the client as the response.
                     It reads the parameters from the request object and performs CRUD operations on the model.
    ```

4. True or False. Django's view layer performs the role of the Application tier in the MVT architecture. 
    - True
    - False

    ```
        Answer: True
        Explanation: A view interacts with both the model and template. It also defines processing logic. Therefore, it is like the application tier in MVT architecture.
    ```

5. Which of the following statements are true about the model in a Django application? Select all that apply.
    - It represents the data layer of the application.
    - It interacts with the view layer.
    - It defines the processing logic.
    - It reflects the database structure.


    ```
        Answer: It represents the data layer of the application.
                It interacts with the view layer.
        Explanation: The model defines attributes and the relationships of data to be processed by the application.
                     The view coordinates with the model to perform database operations.
                     The migration process uses the attributes of a model class to create a table in the database.

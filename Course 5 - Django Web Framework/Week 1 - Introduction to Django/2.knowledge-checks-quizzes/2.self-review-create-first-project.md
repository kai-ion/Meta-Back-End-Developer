3. In the lab you just completed, you created a project called myproject and an app called myapp. Complete the following sentence.

    After running a command to create the project, to create the app, you must
    - Create a directory called myapp and step inside it. 
    - Stay in the same directory and run the command to create the app.
    - Step inside the myproject directory you have created, and run the command to create the app.
    - Step outside to the working directory that you had initially created and run the command to create the app. 

    ```
        Answer: Step inside the myproject directory you have created, and run the command to create the app.
        Explanation: When you run the command to create the project, Django automatically creates the myproject directory. You must step inside this directory and run the command to create the app.

1. Which of the following statements are true about a Django app? Select all that apply. 
    - A Django app must have at least one model in it.
    - A Django app is reusable.
    - The app package folder contains a settings.py file where app-specific configuration is defined.
    - There can be more than one app in a Django project.

    ```
        Answer: A Django app is reusable.
                There can be more than one app in a Django project.
        Explanation: A Django app can be installed in more than one project. An example is Django’s Admin app which can be a part of many projects. 
                     A single project may have one or more apps.
    ```

2. Can the startapp command be used with the django-admin utility?
    - Yes
    - No

    ```
        Answer: Yes
        Explanation: The startapp command option is available with Django-admin and the manage.py script.

3. Which of the following are features of a view? Select all that apply.
    - The request object is the mandatory argument for the view function.
    - The view returns only an HTML response.
    - A view is a user-defined function.
    - A view is mapped to a URL pattern.

    ```
        Answer: The request object is the mandatory argument for the view function.
                A view is a user-defined function.
                A view is mapped to a URL pattern.
        Explanation: The view function receives the request command from the server context and processes the request data, namely parameters and the body.
                     It is a user-defined function in the views.py file under the app folder.
                     You need to specify which URL pattern invokes a particular view. This mapping is defined in the urls.py file of the app.
    ```

4. Which of the following statements about the urls.py  file in the app folder is false? Select all that apply.
    - The URL patterns in the app are defined with the path() function.
    - The urls.py in the apps folder is the same as urls.py in the project folder.
    - The urls.py file at the app-level is included in the urlpatterns list of the project.   
    - The urls.py file is not present in the app folder by default.

    ```
        Answer: The urls.py in the apps folder is the same as urls.py in the project folder.
                The urls.py file at the app-level is included in the urlpatterns list of the project.
        Explanation: Both are different. The app’s urls.py defines the URL mappings of the views in it. The urls.py of the project establishes the base URLs of the site.
                     The URL definitions of the apps installed in the project must be included in the project-level urls.py file.
    ```
